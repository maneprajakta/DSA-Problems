Given two lists sorted in increasing order, create a new list representing the intersection of the two lists. 
The new list should be made with its own memory â€” the original lists should not be changed.

Example 1:

Input:
L1 = 1->2->3->4->6
L2 = 2->4->6->8
Output: 2 4 6
Explanation: For the given first two
linked list, 2, 4 and 6 are the elements
in the intersection.
